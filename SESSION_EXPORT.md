# Mondrian Zero Trust OS - Complete Session Export

## 🎯 Project Status: Ready to Launch

**What We Built:** Evidence-first Zero Trust CLI that blocks risky changes AND proves controls ran. Built in 2 days, ready for community feedback.

## 🚀 Current State

### ✅ Completed
- **Working CLI** with 3 security rules (S3, Security Groups, OIDC)
- **GitHub Actions integration** for blocking risky PRs
- **DSSE signatures** with tamper-evident attestation chains
- **Economic messaging** positioned as "PostHog for Zero Trust"
- **Launch strategy** with platform-specific messaging
- **GitHub Issues tracking** (#3-6) for transparent roadmap

### 🎯 Ready to Execute
**Issue #3: Week 1 Launch** - https://github.com/miqcie/mondrian/issues/3
- Post to r/golang TODAY for technical validation
- Messages ready in LAUNCH_KIT.md
- Metrics tracking via GitHub Issues

## 📋 Key Files in Repository

## 💡 Next Steps
1. **Execute Issue #3** - Start with r/golang post (message ready in LAUNCH_KIT.md)
2. **Monitor community feedback** - Track via GitHub Issues #6
3. **Iterate messaging** based on what resonates
4. **Build requested features** from community input

## 🧠 Key Insights From Session
- **Wedge Strategy**: CLI policy enforcement validates core Zero Trust OS vision
- **Economic Framing**: "Security poverty line" resonates better than technical features
- **Community First**: GitHub Issues > Notion for OSS transparency
- **McCloskey Messaging**: Clear economic arguments beat feature lists

## 🎪 The Big Picture
Mondrian.dev is the **open-source Zero Trust OS for developers**. Current CLI is the thin end of the wedge - proves we can generate reliable evidence and block risky changes. Full vision: passkeys + zero-trust proxy + infra posture + compliance automation in one console.

**Mission**: Lower the "security poverty line" so startups can compete with enterprises from day 1.
